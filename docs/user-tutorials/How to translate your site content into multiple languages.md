# How to translate your GeoJournalism Site into multiple languages:

JEO websites utilize the [qTranslate-X plugin](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com) to enable editors to create multi-lingual content throughout the website. Each content type in the website can support all the languages that site editors have enabled and configured. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will focus on translating posts as the process remains basically the same for the other types of content.

Every post on the website has a unique slug  (named for the [journalism term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(publishing)), not the [slimy creature](http://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/02/17/banana-slugs-secret-of-the-slime/) that can make your tongue numb if you lick it) associated with it.  The language switching is enabled for the entire website with one click. If a user clicks on Nepali language selector [:ne] this choice shows up in the URL of each article like this: 

  - .openearth.net/ne/year/month/day/slug

This means that you do not need to create a new post for every translation but rather include the various language versions within one post.  Editors will see a small set of language buttons above important fields in the post content type and use this to switch between language versions.  

### Translating Titles, Text, Excepts, and Authors
To add a translation of an article: 
1.	Open the post you want to translate in the editor dashboard
2.	Click on one of the language selection tabs 
3.	Add the translated title, main text, excerpt, and author
4.	Update the post 

Here is a screenshot of the language selection buttons for your reference. Take note that you only have to select this once to activate it for all of the fields listed in step 3.

The qTranslateX plugin can make any text on the site multi-lingual but by default it only have a language selector buttons (those little flag tabs) for title, main text, menu, and taxonomy items.  The language switcher buttons aren't available for editors on the author and caption fields. This has been noted as a desired upgrade for future versions of the plug-in.

Adding translated material can be done globally throughout the site by using short codes in the fields you are translation. These short codes match the two letter pattern for each language according to the [ISO 639-1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). 

>[:en]Author in English[:ne]Author in Nepali[:]

For example Ramesh's name should look like this: 
>[:en]Ramesh Bhushal[:ne]रमेश भुसालi[:]

Short codes for the other languages follow this pattern and can include as many languages as are enabled on the site: 
 
>[:en]Your text in English[:]
>[:ne]Your text in Nepali[:]
>[:hi]Your text in Hindi[:]
>[:bn]Your text in Bengali[:]
>[:ur]Your text in Urdu[:]

### Translating Photo Caption using qTranslate-X
Adding a translated caption seems impossible when you are only adding media through the "add media” button up that sits atop the editor.  When the media library pops up there are no language tabs for the caption field.

This is a useability issue. However, it is possible to translate captions. I hope you will soon see, it is really simple.  When you access a photo through the media section in the sidebar, you have the familiar language tabs available for switching between languages. 

Here is where to access the media library via the sidebar menu:

After you select an image, the tabs appear as they normally do. Here is an example with both English and Nepali translation:

This is the full process summarized:

1.	Upload your photos into a story,
2.	Save the story as a draft
3.	Select the media dashboard, and access the images you uploaded
4.	Translate the captions  using the language tabs
5.	Save the media file
6.	Publish your original story.
7.	Done!

When you are done, translated caption should appear within a story for all of the available languages. Otherwise, English will show as the default.

### Publication Time
You now should have all the skills you need to translate your site! You already possess the most important knowledge necessary and that is speaking the languages involved.
